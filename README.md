# Team Feedback Viewer

This project contains a simple csv parsing and viewing application designed for a very specific use case. This is designed to take the output of a google form completed by students and present it in a way that makes grading significantly easier. 

Note that this app is hard coded for the specific problem at hand, and as thus will not be useful to most people.
